    		<p>The 2006 Piston Cup was a heated battle between The King, Chick Hicks, and Lightning McQueen. The three racers started the final race of the season, the Dinoco 400 at the Motor Speedway of the South, with the same number of season points, making the winner of the race the winner of the cup. After an eventful race, where McQueen got close to one lap of advance on the rest of the field and then nearly lost the race after blowing two tires on the last lap, The King, Chick Hicks, and McQueen tied three-way. A tiebreaker 200-lap race was held a week later, at the Los Angeles International Speedway. The King initially held the lead, followed closely by Chick, but Lightning quickly fell behind as he was thinking of his friends at Radiator Springs. However, they came to serve as his pit crew and cheered him on, given him the confidence to catch up to his rivals. In the final lap, Lightning takes the lead, and Chick, fed up with coming second to The King, deliberately sends him rolling off the speedway, causing him to crash violently. Lightning sees this and stops at the finish line to go back and help The King, letting Chick win instead. Lightning then helped The King cross the finish line, allowing them both to finish with dignity. A total of 36 cars competed in the series and three tracks are known.</p>

		<p>Chick Hicks was the official winner of the 2006 Piston Cup, as well as his first title, but his fans and media were outraged at his behavior on the track and booed him for being a cheater. They pelted Chick with debris, forcing him off the stage in humiliation. Lightning was hailed for his good sportsmanship on the track, thus being deemed the "true" winner of the race.</p>
